# Week 4 Mechanical - NAME: ___________ `__/6` 

### All questions pertain to the Ruby language

##### Q1) Assign a hash containing two key/value pairs of your choosing to an instance variable (with a name of your choosing):
<br>


##### Q2) Define a method named `add_numbers` that has two parameters and, when invoked, would return the sum of the two arguments.  For example: `add_numbers 5, 10` would return `15`:
<br><br><br><br><br>

```ruby
lobster = 2
shrimp = 4
```
###### Assuming the above code...

##### Q3) Using string interpolation to insert the value of variables `lobster` in place of "_x_" and `shrimp` in place of "_y_", assign the string "**_There are x lobsters and y shrimp_**", to a variable named `@shellfish_msg`:
<br>

##### Q4) Define a method named `more_shrimp?`, that if invoked like this: `more_shrimp? lobster, shrimp`; would return `true` or `false` depending upon the values being passed in the `lobster` and `shrimp` arguments:
<br><br><br><br><br>

```ruby
class Dog










end
```

##### Q5) Within the class `Dog` above, write an `initialize` method with two parameters: `breed` & `name`; that are used to set the value of two "appropriate" variables.

##### Q6) Create an object using the `Dog` class above having a _breed_ and _name_ of your choosing.  Assign the newly instantiated object to a variable named `@my_dog`:
