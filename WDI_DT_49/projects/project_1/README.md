# Project 1: Client-side Game

## Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**.  You got your feet wet
with Tic-Tac-Toe, now it's time to step it up a notch.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

As a reminder, your project's code **must be substantially yours**. Do not copy code from other similar projects or other sources. However, relying on techniques and a line of code here and there found on StackOverflow is okay.

---

## Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- Render a game in the browser.
- **Code win and/or loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML.** Popup alerts using the `alert()` method are okay during development, but not production.
- **Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files**. Use **semantic HTML** where possible.
- Have **properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. In addition, ensure that your vertical whitespace is consistent.
- No remaining **dead (code that will never be called) and/or commented out code**.
- Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) named as nouns.
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)**. Don't attempt to implement a computer opponent.  This typically requires AI which is beyond the scope of WDI.
- Write **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.
- Use **Use native Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** - your choice. Be consistent however, it's not wise to mix & match.
- **Deploy your game online** using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

## Necessary Deliverables

- A set of User Stories that describe your game's features in the following
  lists in Trello:
  1. MVP
  2. Completed
  2. Icebox.
- **A ``readme.md`` file** with these sections at a minimum:
  1. **<Your game's title>**: A description of your game.  Background info of the game and screenshots are a nice touch.
  2. **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used.
  3. **Getting Started**: Installation instructions. For your game, this section will include the link to your hosted game's site.
  4. **Next Steps**: Unsolved problems and/or planned features.
- The code for **a working game, built by you**, hosted on GitHub,
  with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit often, but don't commit broken code.

>Note: Don't underestimate the value of a `readme.md` well done. Prospective employers will evaluate your `readme.md` file!

### Choose From the Following Games

>Note: Games are listed in approximate order of increasing difficulty.

1. **Hangman** (theming is encouraged)
1. **Connect Four**
1. **War** (the card game)
1. **Blackjack**

1. **Dots & Boxes** (the game played on graph paper)
1. **Minesweeper**
1. **Othello/Reversi**
1. **Checkers** (no AI required - player vs. player instead)
1. **Solitaire**

**Be prepared to share the following with class first thing Thursday morning:**

1. Your choice of game.
2. Your pseudocode for the overall game-play logic.

## Suggestions

- **Begin by wireframing.** Think generally about how you'd
  like your game to look.
- **Pseudocode**. Think about how your game will work.  Ponder what a user does or might do when interacting with your game.
- **List the possible variables (state)** necessary to keep track of the game or display.
- **Use your Development Tools** (`console.log`, DevTools' debugger, `alert` statements) to debug and solve issues.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) to better understand methods, etc.
- **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.**
  Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real
  data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to
  change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose
  game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
- **Theme your game** to make it more unique!

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

- Your instructors will be evaluating your project during your demonstration as well as reviewing the code in your repo.
- If there are deficiencies in meeting the requirements, you will be given guidance on what needs to be done to meet the requirements.  Your updated project will be due the Monday following demo Friday.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like an instructor to provide advice on, please ask.
- After demos, a peer code review checklist will be completed by all students.
