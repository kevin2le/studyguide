# Implement Array Methods 

Implement the following array index methods:

* `map`
* `filter`
* `forEach`
* `some`
* `reduce`
* `sort`

Descriptions for each of these functions are below.

## map 

The `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

```js
function map(array, cb) {

}
```
Documentation about `map`'s API can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).


## filter 

The `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```js
function filter(array,cb) {

}
```
Documentation about `filter`'s API can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).


## forEach 

The `forEach()` method executes a provided function once for each array element.

```js
function forEach(array,cb) {

}
```

Documentation about `forEach`'s API can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach).

## some

The `some()` method tests whether some element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.

```js
function some(array, cb) {

}
```
Documentation about `some`'s API can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some).

## reduce 

The `reduce()` method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

```js
function reduce(array, cb) {

}
```

Documentation about `reduce`'s API can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce).

## Implement Sort 

Implement an algorithm that takes an array of integers as input and returns the an array with these numbers sorted in order.

```js
sort([3,2,1]) //=> [1,2,3]
```
