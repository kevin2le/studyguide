## Todo MVC

You will need to complete three functions/methods:

* `createList`
* `addData(text)`
* `getAllData`

These functions should be added to `app.js`.

#### Writing a createList function 

The `createList` function is your view. It will take `data` as an argument and append all the data to the DOM. You should do this by appending `<li>`s to the `$messages` DOM node. The `$messages` DOM node is a `<ul>` element.

#### Completing Model Methods 

You need to complete two methods on the model object:

* `addData(text)` allows you to add data to out `gaData` array 
*  `getAllData` should return all the data in the `gaData` array
